# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

A 2D Twist on Portal

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A puzzle game where you use portals to move through a level.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will be game with the purpose of entertainment. The features will be character movement, portals between two locations on premade levels, and hopefully a portal launcher to allow players to place their own portals. It will be executed using a folder containing a build of the game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At least three levels with working portals.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

At least three levels with a working portal launcher.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

At least three levels with a working portal gun, and objects to use to solve the puzzles.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to use a game engine. I need to research whether unity or unreal engine would be more ideal for my goals. I will need to research how to create a 2D platformer in my game engine of choice. Once I have basic movement down I will need to learn how to create portals. After that, I will try to learn how to make projectiles work that would form portals on impact with a surface.
